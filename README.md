# Bike Sales Data Cleaning and Dashboard Project in Excel
________
This is a small project I worked on to practice data cleaning in Excel, as well as build my first dashboard in Excel. 

In this repository you will find the raw data in an Exel format, but you will also find the total project which includes 4 sheets, the original raw data, cleaned data in the "working sheet", pivot tables and pivot charts, and the dashboard itself with in the last sheet. The dashboard is interactive and includes slicers so the viewer can filter for specific customer bases at a glance. 

Any questions or comments are always welcome! Please free free to reach out. Below is a preview of the dashboard created.
